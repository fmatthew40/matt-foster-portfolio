 ## Description
 To start, I created a new react app.  I made several components for different sections.  I made an "about me", "contact", "portfolio", and "resume" section.  I also included a header with a navigation bar and a footer.  The footer includes icons that link to my Github, linkedin, and twitter account.  

 The application allows the users to view projects that I added.  It allows them to contact me, read about me, and download a resume.

 ## Usage 
 The project's intended use is to act as a portfolio for potential employers.  The user can view an about me section and a portfolio of projects. The user can fill out a contact form in case they would like to reach out.  A resume is also available for upload in the resume section.
